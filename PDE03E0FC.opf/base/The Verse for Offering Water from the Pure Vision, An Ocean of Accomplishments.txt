From the Pure Vision: The Verse for Offering Water:  An Ocean of Accomplishments
by Dudjom Lingpa

hung, yenlak gyeden dütsi dzingbu di
Hūṃ! This pool of nectar possessing the eight qualities of pure water1
chomden khor dangché la bulwar gyi
I offer now to all the buddhas and their retinues,
shyé né dak dang semchen tamché kyi
As you accept it, may I and all sentient beings
tsok dzok drib dak khorwa dongtruk shok
Gather the accumulations, purify obscurations, and empty saṃsāra from its very depths.
om sarva tatagata saparivara argham pratitsa puja megha samudra saparana samaya a hung
oṃ sarva tathāgata saparivāra arghaṃ pratīccha pūja megha samudra spharaṇa samaya a hūṃ

One night in a dream the lowly Dudjom Dorje had a delusory vision in which a white-coloured
woman appeared saying that she was the ḍākinī Sukhāsiddhī. She pronounced these words and
said, “The verse for offering water together with prayers of aspiration for beings' benefit
is complete.” And the conditions for writing it down in response to a request from Lama
Tsultrim Dorje were provided by Puntsok Tashi. May it be virtuous!
