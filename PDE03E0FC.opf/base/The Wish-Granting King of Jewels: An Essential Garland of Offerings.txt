by Mipham Rinpoche

Ho! Out of the great purity and equalness of appearance and existence,
ma gak rangnang kunzang chöpé trin
Samantabhadra's offering clouds appear spontaneously without obstruction:
lhadzé nyerchö dün dang döyön druk
Divine substances, the seven outer offerings and stimulants of the six senses,
gyalsi na dün tashi dzé tak gyé
The seven emblems of royalty and eight auspicious substances,

Excellent vases, wish-fulfilling trees and treasuries of jewels,

Great clouds of nectar and gardens that yield produce without toil,

Supremely bountiful cows and all the sacred substances of accomplishment,

Food, drink, clothing, ornaments and other precious accoutrements,

All the offering gifts of the gods, nāgas, yakṣas and human beings,

As well as the offerings of the bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions,
chok chu künné trin shyin tib jé shing
All gathered together, amassing like clouds from here, there and everywhere—
rabjam ku sum shying gi köpa kün
These and all the infinite arrays of the three-kāya realms,
kyilkhor lhatsok nam la chöpar bul
We offer to the deities of the maṇḍala:
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.

By sending out these clouds of varied offerings,

The hosts of auspicious goddesses who sing and dance,

Fill the whole expanse of space completely,
lhadzé metok tsok kyi charbeb shing
To bring a rain of divine substances and flowers,
dakshyen go sum gé tsok longchö kün
Which, together with my own and others' virtues of body, speech and mind and all our possessions,
zakmé jorpa gyatsö trin du kö
Form clouds of oceanic, inexhaustible riches.
chewé yönten gyatsor ngakpa yi
And to the accompaniment of music and song of exaltation
tö trin gyatsö drayang dangché té
Praising the vast, ocean-like qualities of greatness,
nangsi detong chöpé chakgya ru
All these infinite clouds of offering that manifest
nampar trulpé chötrin rabjam di
As the offering mudrā of the bliss and emptiness of appearance and existence

We offer to the deities of the maṇḍala:
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.

Like a miraculous creation of the buddhas and their heirs,
chöpa gang nam lamé gyachewa
All these offerings, vast and unsurpassed,
kuntuzangpö chötrin rabjam kyi
Are the infinite, cloud-like offerings of Samantabhadra,
chok dü künkhyab künjung yishyin ter
A wish-granting treasury, a well-spring extending throughout the whole of space and time,
chö kyi ying dang nyampa nyi gyurpé
Equal in extent to the dharmadhātu, the absolute expanse,
zakmé dewé palyön dzepamé
Granting the inexhaustible splendour of immaculate bliss,
zungdzin tsenma kün lé rab depa
Perfectly transcending all notions of subject-object duality,
mejung chöpa chenpo lhün gyi dzok
A vast, wondrous gift that is spontaneously perfect.
nangsi döné namdak dechen shying
Appearance and existence have always been utterly pure, a realm of great bliss,
lhündrub gyalwé jorpa sam mikhyab
And the spontaneously present riches of the victorious ones defy the imagination.

Within Samantabhadra's space of great equality,

We present to the deities of the maṇḍala:
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Grant us supreme and ordinary accomplishments, we pray.
